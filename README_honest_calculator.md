Here I will post my python projects 
This project represent a calculator but not a ordinary one, a very honest calculator with one variable memory. This simple calculator is going to motivate users
to try and do the math themselves by becoming more and more honest with them. For example, if they need to do calculations with multidigit numbers, that, okay, 
might be tricky,so the calculator won't be very hard on them and just solve it. However, if the equation is a simple sum of two integers like 2 + 3, maybe it 
should suggest solving it themselves.
