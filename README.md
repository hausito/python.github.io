I made a X_O game (2 PLAYERS) (Tic Tac Toe)

Tic-tac-toe is a game known all over the world. Each country may have its own version of the name,
sometimes the rules are different, but the essence of the game remains the same. 
Below are the main rules that may be familiar to you since childhood.

Tic-tac-toe is played by two players on a 3x3 grid. One of the players is 'X', and the other player is 'O'. 
X plays first, then O takes the next turn, and so on.

The players write 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 field.

The first player that puts 3 X's or 3 O's in a straight line (including diagonals) wins the game.

You can run it with your python console or command prompt 

If you find some bugs leave them in the comments
also you can leave an advice how to improve the code for better functionality

Thank you !
